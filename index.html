    <p class="para">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements, ID, on the other hand, appiles a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>

    <p class="para">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be appiled to the element.</p>
<p class="para">There is a wide range of selection available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be appiled.</p>
